# Readme

## TODOs:
- Per-Pool Priorit√§ten for threads
- Thread pool naming (i.e., set/get string name for thread pool object)
- Thread naming inside pool (e.g., "worker-", then 1st thread is "worker-1", 2nd is "worker2") etc.
- Rename gecko_pool to thread_pool_t or gecko_thread_pool (conflict with string pool naming)
- Statistics per pool (e.g., min/max/avg/mean run time, idle time, job time)
- Statistics per thread (e.g., run time, idle time, job time,...)
- Method to increase/decrease # of threads in pool
- Error checking (e.g., null check with require_nonnull macro)
- code "Documentation" from HackMd to doxygen code docu in sources
