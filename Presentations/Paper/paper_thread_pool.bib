	abstract	= {Priority queues are fundamental to many multiprocessor
	applications. Several priority queue algorithms based on
	skiplists have been proposed, as skiplists allow concurrent
	accesses to different parts of the data structure in a
	simple way. However, for priority queues on
	multiprocessors, an inherent bottleneck is the operation
	that deletes the minimal element. We present a
	linearizable, lock-free, concurrent priority queue
	algorithm, based on skiplists, which minimizes the
	contention for shared memory that is caused by the
	\textsc{DeleteMin} operation. The main idea is to minimize
	the number of global updates to shared memory that are
	performed in one \textsc{DeleteMin}. In comparison with
	other skiplist-based priority queue algorithms, our
	algorithm achieves a 30 - 80\% improvement.}
